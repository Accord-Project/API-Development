# API-Development
We have initially developed a list of API that we must explore. Below we will collect existing work in this area and existing open standards

1. **Definitions** – Communicating Definitions from BSDD to the other components

2. **Rules** – Communicating rules from GraphDB to other components


3. **Information Services** – microservices accessing information from information services



4. **Data** – retrieving data against which a compliance check is performed (semantic/non-semantic)



5. **Management** – management of microservice orchestration



6. **Reports/Feedback** – triggering and getting feedback from microservices
