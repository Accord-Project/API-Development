# API-Development
We have initially developed a list of API that we must explore. Below we will collect existing work in this area and existing open standards

1. **Definitions** – Communicating Definitions from BSDD to the other components
    a. Here we should re-use the BSDD API https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/buildingSMART/Dictionaries/v1

3. **Rules** – Communicating rules from GraphDB to other components


4. **Information Services** – microservices accessing information from information services



5. **Data** – retrieving data against which a compliance check is performed (semantic/non-semantic)



6. **Management** – management of microservice orchestration



7. **Reports/Feedback** – triggering and getting feedback from microservices
